# Names
Web app to suggest a name to an israeli child

This web app, developed with FastAPI, Scikit-learn, and KNN, predicts and suggests Israeli person names. FastAPI provides a fast web framework for APIs, while Scikit-learn offers powerful machine learning tools. KNN, a simple yet effective algorithm, is used for prediction. By inputting person characteristics, the app recommends Israeli names based on nearest neighbors in the trained model. Overall, it combines these technologies to deliver an efficient and user-friendly Israeli name prediction application. https://github.com/itayG98/Names
